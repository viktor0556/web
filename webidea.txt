Website idea: Quit tracking and Motivational Platform

Idea:
Let's make a website that helps people quit bad habits like watching porn and smoking. The purpose of the website is to support users in developing new and healthy habits.

Main Functions:

Withdrawal Calendar:

It gives users the opportunity to use a calendar where two main types of quitting can be followed: days without watching porn and days without smoking.
Through the calendar, users can tick each day if they have not watched or smoked porn that day.
You can assign milestones to each day to help you track changes. For example, after the first day we can display with a small text that "First day: No change change."
Motivational Texts:

The website provides motivational texts to help users persevere. For example, if someone hasn't watched porn for 2 days, we can display texts.
Smoking Tracking:

To quit smoking, users can register when they lit up. Based on this, we can count the smoke-free days and make the various milestones available, such as 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, half a year.
Relapse Treatment:

The website should have some sort of support mechanism or community feature where users can help each other avoid relapse.
